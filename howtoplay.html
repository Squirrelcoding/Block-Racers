    <h3>The goal</h3>
    <p id="Font2">Block racers! is a game where 2 people share a computer and have to get to the goal which is constantly moving! The goal is the black box. Player 1 (Blue Box) goes against Player 2 (Red Box) and race to the black box first! If you are unable to reach the black box due to its location, click the "regenerate Goal Location box!" and its in a new location! And your progress is saved! Note: 2 people pressing different keys are going to be difficult playing this game.</p>
